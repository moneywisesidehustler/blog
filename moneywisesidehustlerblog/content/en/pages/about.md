#### Hey! I'm Chelsea Suddens

A mother to a young boy and another due September (2 under 2). Sharing our journey of building various income streams to achieve a goal of financial freedom by 2032. All while balancing increasing costs of living, full time employment and family life.

By day I'm a solution architect and by night I balance my family life as a wife and mother with my various side hustles. This blog will cover a variety of things including:
* Work/Life Balance
* Tips for Saving Money
* Feeding a family on a budget
* Building multiple sources of income
* Keeping organised
* Making every day count
* Our journey to financial freedom

There are a lot of dreams I have but there are some dreams that I desperately want to make a reality. That is to have financial freedom by 2032 and travel the world for 1-2 years while my children are 10-12 years old... To give them some perspective of what lies out there in the world, build their confidence and sense of adventure and make up for the honeymoon my husband and I missed out on due to COVID.
